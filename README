Shibui is a light-weight and simple Content Management System geared towards smaller websites (Under 10 pages). This system uses JSON to store content and website settings. The advantage this is lightning-fast load times, and effortless deployments. This project is currently in the Alpha stages and the beta release is projected for June.
